High-Throughput Plasmid Design Webapp

This web-app is a plasmid design tool that incorporates a Python backend. Using the webapp2 web framework and the jinja libraries, HTML files with accompanying CSS framework are loaded in, rendered by Jinja, and served on the web framework.

The main interface enables user control of part input and configuration of user settings. Input parts can be manipulated on the main page by dragging and dropping them. When ready, select the appropriate assembly method and click "Assemble".

On the assembly output page, results are shown in tabular format and can be downloaded in CSV format. Be sure to do a QC check of the results to make sure they are correct.
